# Fibonacci-series
1. The Fibonacci program is invoked by calling a method fib.
2. n is the total number of terms and first term(a) and second term(b) are initialized as 0 and 1.
3. Then, the for loop iterates till n displaying a as the sum of previous two terms.
   ->1st Iteration:
     Sum = 0 + 1;
     a = 1;
     b = 1;
   ->2nd Iteration:
     Sum = 1 + 1;
     a = 1;
     b = 2;
   ->3rd Iteration:
     Sum = 1 + 2;
     a = 2;
     b = 3;
   and so on...
4. Two test cases are taken where n = 8 and n = 10.


How to run the program 
1. javac Fibonacci.java is used to compile. 
2. java Fibonacci is used to execute the program.
